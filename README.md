# SIO 217A: Cloud Nucleation
Term project on cloud nucleation, specifically droplet growth rates.

## Deadlines
- T 11/12 at 11am = recreate Table 5.5 and sent to instructor
- F 11/15 at 11am = perform sensitivity analysis and send results to instructor
- F 11/22 at 11am = send report to instructor for peer review
- M 11/25 at 11am = peer review comments due
- M 12/2 and W 12/14 = in-class presentations
- F 12/6 at 5:30pm = submit final paper and responses to peer comments to instructor

## Report Requirements
A 3 page paper that includes:

1. Introduction: a brief summary how the topic affects atmospheric thermodynamics.
2. Description of the model, its assumptions, and its possible shortcomings.
3. Physical significance of the model parameters you are calculating and varying.
4. Conclusions you draw from your modeling study, with as much physical insight as the modeling results allow. (For example, "As the initial water vapor content of the parcel is increased, more latent heat is available and a more vertical development is observed".)

Suggested points to include in the discussion:

- What are the assumptions of the model about the process(es) you are studying? How does this affect your conclusions?
- What is the physical significance of the changes you are making to the code? Are the model results consistent with your expectations?

You and your readers will find it helpful if your discussion uses the relevant concepts you have learned in class. Your discussion can make reference to the figures that show the results of your model in variables relevant to your topic. These figures should be designed to be easy to understand, and they may require additional labels and formatting beyond what is in your programming language, so you may want to use a different graphics package for the figures.
